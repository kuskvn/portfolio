		In my reflection for the final project, I looked mainly into the color brown. 
		In this section, I instead want to focus upon what is evoked by the color beige. 
		Not only was this used throughout my site as a whole, but itâ€™s a color that I use 
		frequently throughout my own life in design decisions. Throughout my research, I found 
		that beige was mostly associated with unification. In addition, many cultures associate 
		beige with pleasantness and calmness. Finally, ivory, a color very much associated with 
		beige, is often associated with purity and simplicity. With these in mind, I felt that 
		beige fit the tone of the site extremely well, and my design decisions felt largely 
		justified. My the same token, some of the reference sites that I used incorporated the 
		color in the same way that I had intended.
