					This was is a short story dealing with the subject of advocacy

					A poem I wrote that culminates a lot of my early experiences in 
					college, consummating some of what I've heard from friends and from
					my chances to speak with other students. It has a lot to do with
					expectations, and I got the chance to workshop it with a group of
					other people in the poetry department.

					This is a sample research paper that's also tied to my unit plan.
					It's as much a paper in and of itself as it is meant to be an

					Many educators (myself included), really appreciate CharacterLab
					for it's multifaceted approach to helping learners develop their 
					skills. This workbook on effective practice is not only able to 
					provide students opportunities to develop themselves, but also 
					is a useful tool for students seeking opportunities to learn 
					through a set of excersizes or tasks.

					While I like most episodes of the School Me Podcast, episode 
					ninety-nine deals very specifically with seeking opportunity 
					for oneself, especially in the context of the education 
					workplace. While this definitely isn't the easiest starting 
					place for every student, I'd encourage students who prefer
					audio-based formats to look for whatever handful of specific 
					topics that they cover to take inspiration from.

					Ekphrastic peotry has to do with seeking significance or 
					discerning what makes a piece of art resonate with oneself 
					or another group on a personal level. Brian Teare has an 
					especially strong ability to do so in this piece about pop
					artist Jasper Johns's work.

					Advocacy involves the process of communicating the most 
					rewarding as well as most discouraging parts of your life. 
					While this inclusion is more oriented for the educators and 
					future educators who will see this project. This set of comics 
					is made by a schoolteacher, and it does an great, if not 
					lighthearted job of demonstrating all the different aspects that 
					go into their job-- an elegant illustration of fulfillment and 
					frustration.
